  spec.description   = <<~DESC
    RailsForge does not replace ruby-lsp. This gem is a ruby-lsp add-on (RubyLsp::Addon)
    that augments ruby-lsp's own hover and completion responses with Rails-specific
    context (ActiveRecord column names/types, route helpers) sourced from the same
    db/schema.rb and config/routes.rb parsing RailsForge's VS Code side already does.
    Install it alongside Shopify's ruby-lsp gem; ruby-lsp discovers and loads it
    automatically via the addon API.
